abstract = {We re-examine the 2012 local government elections in New South Wales, Australia. The count was conducted electronically using a randomised form of the Single Transferable Vote (STV). It was already well known that randomness does make a difference to outcomes in some seats. We describe how the process could be amended to include a demonstration that the randomness was chosen fairly.Second, and more significantly, we found an error in the official counting software, which caused a mistake in the count in the council of Griffith, where candidate Rina Mercuri narrowly missed out on a seat. We believe the software error incorrectly decreased Mercuri's winning probability to about 10%---according to our count she should have won with 91% probability.The NSW Electoral Commission (NSWEC) corrected their code when we pointed out the error, and made their own announcement.We have since investigated the 2016 local government election (held after correcting the error above) and found two new errors. We notified the NSWEC about these errors a few days after they posted the results.},

abstract = {There is a shortage of routing protocols that meet the needs of network engineers. This has led to BGP being pressed into service as an IGP, despite its lack of convergence guarantees. The development, standardization, and deployment of routing protocols, or even minor changes to existing protocols, are very difficult tasks. We present an approach called Metarouting that defines routing protocols using a high-level and declarative language. Once an interpreter for a metarouting language is implemented on a router, a network operator would have the freedom to implement and use any routing protocol definable in the language. We enforce a clean separation of protocol mechanisms (link-state, path-vector, adjacency maintenance, and so on) from routing policy (how routes are described and compared). The Routing Algebra framework of Sobrinho [25] is used as the theoretical basis for routing policy languages. We define the Routing Algebra Meta-Language (RAML) that allows for the construction of a large family of routing algebras and has the key property that correctness conditions --- guarantees of convergence with respect to the chosen mechanisms --- can be derived automatically for each expression defining a new routing algebra.},

Freenet operates as a network of identical nodes that collectively pool their storage space to store data files and cooperate to route requests to the most likely physical location of data. No broadcast search or centralized location index is employed. Files are referred to in a location-independent manner, and are dynamically replicated in locations near requestors and deleted from locations where there is no interest. It is infeasible to discover the true origin or destination of a file passing through the network, and dificult for a node operator to determine or be held responsible for the actual physical contents of her own node.",

From formal proofs of basic sanity conditions for each mechanism inside the Coq theorem prover, we then synthesise code that implements the given scheme in a provably correct way and produces a universally verifiable certificate of the count. We have applied this to various variations of STV, including several used in Australian parliamentary elections and demonstrated the feasibility of our approach by means of real-world case studies.",

abstract="In the world's largest-ever deployment of online voting, the iVote Internet voting system was trusted for the return of 280,000 ballots in the 2015 state election in New South Wales, Australia. During the election, we performed an independent security analysis of parts of the live iVote system and uncovered severe vulnerabilities that could be leveraged to manipulate votes, violate ballot privacy, and subvert the verification mechanism. These vulnerabilities do not seem to have been detected by the election authorities before we disclosed them, despite a pre-election security review and despite the system having run in a live state election for five days. One vulnerability, the result of including analytics software from an insecure external server, exposed some votes to complete compromise of privacy and integrity. At least one parliamentary seat was decided by a margin much smaller than the number of votes taken while the system was vulnerable. We also found protocol flaws, including vote verification that was itself susceptible to manipulation. This incident underscores the difficulty of conducting secure elections online and carries lessons for voters, election officials, and the e-voting research community.",

However, the present state of the art in vote counting leaves much to be desired: while some jurisdictions publish the source code of vote counting code, others treat the code as commercial in confidence. None of the systems in use today applies any formal verification. In this paper, we formally specify the so-called Schulze method, a vote counting scheme that is gaining popularity on the open source community. The cornerstone of our formalisation is a (dependent, inductive) type that represents all correct executions of the vote counting scheme. Every inhabitant of this type not only gives a final result, but also all intermediate steps that lead to this result, and can so be externally verified. As a consequence, we do not even need to trust the execution of the (verified) algorithm: the correctness of a particular run of the vote counting code can be verified on the basis of the evidence for correctness that is produced along with determination of election winners.",
