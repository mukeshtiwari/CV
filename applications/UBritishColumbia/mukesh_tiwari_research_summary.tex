\maketitle

Many countries in recent years are introducing computers to conduct some part, or all, of 
election processes because it is cost effective, accessible to disabled voters, faster result, convenient, etc. 
In addition, some voting methods are very complex to count by hand, e.g.,
single transferable vote (STV) used in Australian Senate elections.  Moreover, several cantons 
in Switzerland use an electronic 
voting system developed by SwissPost, India uses electronic voting machines, many provinces in 
Canada use computer ballot counting (vote tabulators), etc.  However, many of these software 
programs are bug-ridden, demonstrated by various security researchers, and my research addresses 
(eliminates) the problem of bugs in software programs used in elections.
