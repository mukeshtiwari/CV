Dear Hiring Committee, 
\\
%references such as what and how you got this information
\vspace{1em}
I have extensive experience of software engineering (security) research, in particular 
election software security, cryptography, theorem proving (logic), and social choice theory. 
In addition, I am willing to expand my research horizons in other research 
areas, e.g., explainable 
AI using logic, etc. I also have 3 years of teaching and administration experience 
at an Indian university, International Institute of Information Technology, 
Bhubanesware, Odisha, India. My research has already published in 
top-tier conferences and I find the University of Adelaide a perfect 
place for me to continue my research. 

Diversity and inclusion matters a lot to me because of my own background (born in 
a remote Indian village with no school). I believe everyone is capable of 
achieving everything, all they need is support.
