\maketitle


I have been awarded many scholarships during my education. For example, 
I have been awarded the international PhD scholarship and fees remission by the Australian 
National University. In addition, DeepSpec summer school and Marktoberdorf 
summer school awarded me a full scholarship based on my work in interactive 
theorem proving (unfortunately, I could not attend the Marktoberdorf summer school 
because of the visa issue). I listing these scholarships as an achievements 
because without these scholarships I could not have been able to afford my PhD, or meet 
new researchers due to my background (I come from a remote Indian village without 
access to a proper school). Moreover, I am an avid programming and math problems 
solver which led to me win many programming competitions. During my university, 
I was the amongst the top 10 problem solver of Project 
Euler\footnote{\url{https://projecteuler.net}}.
