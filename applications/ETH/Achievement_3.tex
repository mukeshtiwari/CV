\maketitle


When I was working as an assistant professor in International Institute of 
Information Technology (IIIT) Bhubanesware, I participated in teaching 
workshops, organised by the student body of IIIT, to teach the 
children of migrant workers, working as a construction worker in IIIT.
In addition, every year when I visit my village 
in summer, I teach physics, mathematics, and basic computer literacy course to 
all the children, coming from 
economically underdeveloped community, working in 
agricultural field in evenings. However, I lack funds to buy computers for everyone 
and therefore, I have been recently trying to encouraging people to donate 
their computers. My long term goal is to lower the gap of digital divide and make the 
children from economically underdeveloped community literate in computer education 
and employable in computer industry to break the cycle of poverty.
