Dear Hiring Committee, 

My name is Mukesh Tiwari and currently I am working at the University of Cambridge as 
a senior research associate. I am writing to apply the job 
\textit{Faculty Positions in Computer and Communications 
Sciences}. My work aims to build \textbf{correct software programs} deployed in democratic processes 
using the Coq theorem prover. In particular, I focus on formal verification of 
software programs used in elections (electronic voting), cryptography, and computational social choice theory. 


My research is highly relevant for the Swiss democracy. In my current ongoing, I trying to 
mitigate the problems in SwissPost source code. For example, group generator, scrutiny sheet checker, 
modelling the SwissPost choreographic algorithms in the Coq theorem prover. In addition, 
I find EPFL an excellent place to pursue my decentralised peer-to-peer document leak 
system because Bryan Ford already, developer of Dissent, works at EPFL. 



My diverse skills --formal verification, electronic voting, cryptography, 
and social choice theory-- makes me an unique candidate for this position.
