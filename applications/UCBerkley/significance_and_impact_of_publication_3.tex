\section{Machine-checking Multi-Round Proofs of Shuffle: Terelius-Wikstrom and Bayer-Groth}
Author List: Thomas Haines, Rajeev Gore, Mukesh Tiwari (I worked on special soundness and zero-knowledge proof)

Evidence producing (verifiable) mix-network is a critical part of e-voting, but
there is currently no mathematically proven correct implementation of mix-networks.
This paper develops a verified implementation of Bayer-Groth mix-network in the Coq theorem prover 
and prove that it follows (i) completeness, (ii) (special) soundness and (iii) zero-knowledge proof. 
In addition, it also debunks the decade old myth that Terelius-Wikstrom algorithm 
is a zero-knowledge proof. We have proved in the Coq theorem prover that it is a 
zero-knowledge argument. This is first, to the best of my knowledge, mathematically proven 
correct implementation of mix-network and 
our implementation can be used to verify Swiss elections 
(Bayer-Groth mix-network is used in elections in Switzerland).
