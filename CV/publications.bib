abstract="Verifpal is a new automated modeling framework and verifier for cryptographic protocols, optimized with heuristics for common-case protocol specifications, that aims to work better for real-world practitioners, students and engineers without sacrificing comprehensive formal verification features. In order to achieve this, Verifpal introduces a new, intuitive language for modeling protocols that is easier to write and understand than the languages employed by existing tools. Its formal verification paradigm is also designed explicitly to provide protocol modeling that avoids user error.",

abstract="We introduce a formal, modular framework that captures a large number of different instances of the Single Transferable Vote (STV) counting scheme in a uniform way. The framework requires that each instance defines the precise mechanism of counting and transferring ballots, electing and eliminating candidates. From formal proofs of basic sanity conditions for each mechanism inside the Coq theorem prover, we then synthesise code that implements the given scheme in a provably correct way and produces a universally verifiable certificate of the count. We have applied this to various variations of STV, including several used in Australian parliamentary elections and demonstrated the feasibility of our approach by means of real-world case studies.",

abstract="We argue that electronic vote-counting software can engender broad-based public trust in elections to public office only if they are formally verified against their legal definition and only if they can produce an easily verifiable certificate for the correctness of the count. We then show that both are achievable for the Schulze method of vote-counting, even when the election involves millions of ballots. We argue that our methodology is applicable to any vote-counting scheme that is rigorously specified. Consequently, the current practice of using unverified and unverifiable vote counting software for elections to public office is untenable. In particular, proprietary closed source vote-counting software is simply inexcusable.",

pages="410--426",
abstract="The correctness of vote counting in electronic election is one of the main pillars that engenders trust in electronic elections. However, the present state of the art in vote counting leaves much to be desired: while some jurisdictions publish the source code of vote counting code, others treat the code as commercial in confidence. None of the systems in use today applies any formal verification. In this paper, we formally specify the so-called Schulze method, a vote counting scheme that is gaining popularity on the open source community. The cornerstone of our formalisation is a (dependent, inductive) type that represents all correct executions of the vote counting scheme. Every inhabitant of this type not only gives a final result, but also all intermediate steps that lead to this result, and can so be externally verified. As a consequence, we do not even need to trust the execution of the (verified) algorithm: the correctness of a particular run of the vote counting code can be verified on the basis of the evidence for correctness that is produced along with determination of election winners.",

  pages={824-828},

  abstract={The wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are being deployed frequently in variety of environments such as military surveillance, forest fire monitoring, chemical leakage monitoring etc. Sensor nodes have limited communication capability and low computation resources so each node is weak entity that can be easily compromised by adversary by launching malicious software inside the network. Performance evaluation of wireless sensor network requires realistic modeling of intrusion detection system since most of WSNs are application specific. In WSN, nodes have specific properties such as stable neighbors' information that helps in detection of anomalies in network. Nodes monitor their neighborhood and collaborate with cluster head to detect malicious behavior. Even though nodes don't have global view but they can still detect an intrusion with certain probability and report to cluster head. This paper introduces a specification based intrusion detection system for wireless sensor networks.},

  year={2009},

  volume={},

  number={},

  pages={1111-1116},

  abstract={The stream control transmission protocol (SCTP) uses a cookie mechanism to tackle the security and traditional attack scenario. Unfortunately, SCTP is not secured against redirection attacks, bombing attacks and towards verification-tag guessing attacks which lead to association-hijacking and may force the victim client to starve out of service from the server. Therefore, we propose a secure SCTP mechanism that uses an additional new SCTP chunk with cryptographic hash operation to check the integrity of the client that helps in easy detection/prevention of some traditional attacks in the SCTP. Using this, the cookie mechanism can be minimized to clear-text.},
